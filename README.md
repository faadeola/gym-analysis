# Introduction
This report presents an analysis of a gymâ€™s member exercise dataset, provided to understand metrics associated with over 900 entries, each representing one gym member's workout data over a period of time. Data provided includes age, gender, session duration, calories burned, and workout frequency.

The goal of this analysis is to explore the relationship and trend between different data and provide discoveries that could help make informed decisions. Typically, this analysis identifies the correlation between session duration and calories burned through scatter plotting and also checks for the effect of each workout type on the average calories burned.
